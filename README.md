# Department-Training
A group of agents is called a department and this repo is a MARL experiment using pygame to train some agents

The first game to be learned is a simple point and shoot battle with three teams, green, grey, and red. Green 
and red gain rewards if the opposing team is hit, while grey gains rewards based only on survival. Both teams 
can in clude human controlled agents and should learn to work with such agents accordingly. This project 
utilizes pytorch, pygame, and the multi agent library, Petting Zoo.
